Personal configuration files for neovim and others

To setup neovim, first install it on your local system, then run install-nvim.sh from your terminal. 
To remove, run clean-nvim.sh and it will delete the newly created folders. Be warned: it will not restore any old configurations.
This is for my personal use and is not production ready software. Use this code at your own risk.
